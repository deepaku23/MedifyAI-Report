## Deployemnt Automation through Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline

### Overview
Our project implements a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, ensuring automated testing, building, and deployment of our healthcare application components. This automation pipeline is defined in two key workflow files: `.github/workflows/continuous_integration.yml` for testing and `.github/workflows/continuous_deployment.yml` for deployment, creating a seamless path from development to production.

### Continuous Integration Process
Our CI pipeline automatically triggers on pull requests to the staging branch, specifically monitoring changes in the backend directory. The pipeline executes comprehensive testing of both ML and data components:

The ML pipeline testing encompasses multiple critical areas:
- Retrieval validation ensuring accurate case matching
- Bias metric evaluation for fairness in medical responses
- Integrated pipeline testing for end-to-end functionality
- Environment variable validation for secure configuration

The data pipeline testing validates:
- Data download processes
- Preprocessing functionality
- Data quality checks

Each test execution is monitored, with automated email notifications sent to the team indicating success or failure, enabling quick response to any issues that arise during the integration process.

### Continuous Deployment Strategy
The deployment pipeline, triggered automatically on pushes to the main branch from the staging branch, handles the deployment of both frontend and backend components to our EKS cluster. The process includes:

1. **Container Image Building**
   - Automated building of Docker images for both frontend and backend
   - Push to Amazon ECR with versioning
   - Platform-specific builds (linux/amd64) for compatibility

2. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Automatic update of EKS cluster configuration
   - Rolling deployment to ensure zero-downtime updates
   - Service configuration and load balancer setup
   - Health check validation

3. **Notification System**
   - Automated email notifications for deployment status
   - Detailed reporting of success/failure for each component
   - Team-wide communication of deployment results

This automated pipeline ensures that our medical analysis system remains current and reliable, with minimal manual intervention required for updates and deployments. The process maintains high standards for testing and deployment while providing comprehensive monitoring and notification systems for the development team.
